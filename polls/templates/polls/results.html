<h1>{{ question.question_text }}</h1>

<ul>
{% for choice in question.choice_set.all %}
    <!-- 
    FLAW #5: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The software assumes that the choice_text is sanitized and safe, 
    even though it can be added by any user (and bypassing the Django provided default admin functionality). This enables
    malicious user to add html/or embedded js to the web page in form of a new vote option.
     
    TESTING: Paste following into the "Add your option" text box and submit: <script>alert("I am an alert box!");</script>
    This causes the script to be included as an vote option and it is parsed as a part of the web page, showing the alert box 
    for every subsequent reload of the results.html (tested as working on Windows/Chrome)

    FIX #5: Change {{ choice.choice_text | safe}} to {{ choice.choice_text }} to re-enable Django's built-in escaping 
    -->
    <li>{{ choice.choice_text | safe}} -- {{ choice.votes }} vote{{ choice.votes|pluralize }}</li>
{% endfor %}
